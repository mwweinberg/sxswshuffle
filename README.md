# sxswshuffle
reconciles the two SXSW music directories

Takes two input directories (michael_input and jessica_input) and sorts the files they contain into three new output directories depending on if they are unique or shared between the folders.  It then renames the album in the two unique directories to clarify who picked the song and adds album art based on the SXSW logo to all files.
